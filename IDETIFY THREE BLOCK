Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

ANSWER-
BLOCK-
In Python, a block of code refers to a group of statements that are grouped together and executed as a single unit. Blocks in Python are defined by their indentation level. Indentation is crucial in Python, as it determines the scope and organization of your code.

Blocks are typically used in control structures such as conditional statements (if-else) and loops (for, while). Here's an example of an if-else block:

```python
if condition:
    # Code block executed if condition is true
    statement1
    statement2
    # ...
else:
    # Code block executed if condition is false
    statement3
    statement4
    # ...
```

In the above example, the code block under the `if` statement is executed if the condition is true.
If the condition is false, the code block under the `else` statement is executed.

Similarly, here's an example of a for loop block:

```python
for item in iterable:
    # Code block executed for each item in the iterable
    statement1
    statement2
    # ...
```

In this case, the code block under the `for` statement is executed for each item in the `iterable`.

It's important to note that Python uses indentation to define blocks, and the standard convention is to use four spaces for each indentation level. 
Incorrect or inconsistent indentation can result in syntax errors or unexpected behavior in your code.



SO,
spam = 0
if spam == 10:     ------------------------------------------ FIRST BLOCK
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:       ------------------------------------------ SECOND BLOCK
print('bacon')
else:              ------------------------------------------ THIRD BLOCK
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')
