How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
In Python, `break` and `continue` are two control flow statements used within loops (such as `for` and `while`) to alter the flow of execution. Here's how they differ:

1. **break:** 
The `break` statement is used to terminate the current loop and immediately exit the loop's block of code.
When a `break` statement is encountered, the program will jump to the first statement after the loop.
This means that any remaining iterations of the loop will be skipped, and the program continues to execute from the point immediately after the loop.

   Example:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, 6):
       if i == 3:
           break
       print(i)
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   1
   2
   ```

   In this example, when `i` becomes 3, the `break` statement is encountered, causing the loop to terminate. 
   Therefore, only the values 1 and 2 are printed before the loop is exited.

2. **continue:**
The `continue` statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration.
When a `continue` statement is encountered, the program will jump to the next iteration without executing the remaining statements in the loop's block.

   Example:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, 6):
       if i == 3:
           continue
       print(i)
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   1
   2
   4
   5
   ```

   In this example, when `i` becomes 3, the `continue` statement is encountered. 
   As a result, the remaining statements in the loop are skipped, and the program moves to the next iteration.
   Hence, the value 3 is not printed.

To summarize, `break` is used to completely exit a loop, while `continue` is used to skip the current iteration and move to the next iteration of the loop.
