Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
Certainly! Here's the code for printing the numbers 1 to 10 using a `for` loop:

```python
for i in range(1, 11):
    print(i)
```

And here's the equivalent program using a `while` loop:

```python
i = 1
while i <= 10:
    print(i)
    i += 1
```

Both programs will produce the same output:

```
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
```

In the `for` loop version, we utilize the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and iterate over each number using the loop variable `i`.

In the `while` loop version, we initialize the variable `i` with the value 1 and repeatedly execute the loop block as long as `i` is less than or equal to 10. Inside the loop, we print the current value of `i` and increment it by 1 (`i += 1`) to ensure the loop eventually terminates.
