5. What are the six comparison operators?

The six comparison operators commonly used in programming languages are:

1. Equal to (==): This operator compares two values and returns true if they are equal, and false otherwise.

2. Not equal to (!=): This operator compares two values and returns true if they are not equal, and false if they are equal.

3. Greater than (>): This operator compares two values and returns true if the left operand is greater than the right operand, and false otherwise.

4. Less than (<): This operator compares two values and returns true if the left operand is less than the right operand, and false otherwise.

5. Greater than or equal to (>=): This operator compares two values and returns true if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand, and false otherwise.

6. Less than or equal to (<=): This operator compares two values and returns true if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand, and false otherwise.

These operators are commonly used in conditional statements, loops, and other situations where you need to compare values in programming.
