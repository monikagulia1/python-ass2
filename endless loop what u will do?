If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
In Python, if your program is stuck in an endless loop and you want to interrupt its execution, you can use the following steps:

1. Press **Ctrl+C** on your keyboard. This keyboard combination works on most platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
It sends an interrupt signal to the Python interpreter, causing it to terminate the program.

2. If Ctrl+C doesn't work, you can try using the **Stop** button or **Interrupt** button in your integrated development environment (IDE) or code editor.
These buttons are typically available in the toolbar or menu of your IDE, and they are specifically designed to stop the execution of a running program.

3. Alternatively, you can also close the terminal or command prompt window where the program is running. 
This will forcibly terminate the Python process and stop the program.

Remember, it's important to be cautious when interrupting the execution of a program.
Make sure you've saved any necessary data and consider implementing proper error handling and termination conditions in your code to avoid getting stuck in infinite loops in the first place.
